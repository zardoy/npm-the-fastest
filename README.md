# NPM The Fastest

Under heavy development, I want to make it the most comprehensive tool for working with NPM ecosystem inside VSCode

## Features

- Keeps dependencies always in sync with your package manager (editing: [ ] watch: [ ])
- Doesn't support yarn2
<!-- - Works with any package managers best with pnpm!
- [ ] workspaces and monorepos support
- Fastest plugin for
- \> 50 commands should save you a lot of time -->

## `src` Directory Structure

- `src/commands-core` - command-related code
- `src/core` general code, that can be used outside of vscode
<!-- TODO: linter don't allow to use vscode module inside src/core -->
